# rusticua

A simple web app to help learning ukrainian language through some simple gamificated challenges, written in Rust

### Roadmap

`rusticua` should be as simple as possible, but still meeting minimum polishness standards

#### Stack

For this reason, it has been decided to leverage below stack:

`leptos`: main webframework for frontend SPA
<br>
`actix`: simple webserver framework to serve both `API` and `frontend`
<br>
`htmx`: ultra-modern `HTML` extension to write almost natively reactive `html` elements

#### Challenges

At the moment the only challenge under development is a cyrillic memory-game, but more challenges will be added in the future

- [UNDER DEVELOPMENT] cyrillic-latin memory-game
- [TODO] words memory-game
- [TODO] words association game
- [TODO] common phrases translation


## Usage/Examples

clone this repo `cd` into it and use `cargo-watch` to run it

install `cargo-watch`

```bash
cargo install cargo-watch
```

run the app

```bash
cargo watch -x run
```

now a local server should be running and your app visible locally at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)
